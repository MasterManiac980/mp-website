									</li>
									<li>
										I have also covered some tangentially related information connected to
										networking such as static IPs vs DHCP, subnet masks, and DNS

								<h3>Networking</h3>
								<div id="switch-installation">
									<h4>Switch Installation</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>
											Worked with Sophia to install the new network switches both in "The
											Servery" and in COSI's rack in COLO

											Learned about how to configure a managed switch and gained a better

									<h4>Breaking the Network</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>
											As of writing this (Sat. 10/7 @ 2:54am), I still don't know what went
											wrong, everything seems to have been returned to its original state and yet,
											its still broken
										</li>
										<li>
											As of writing this (Tues. 10/10 @ 1:59am), I've been working with OIT to
											test a variety of possible solutions ranging from unplugging and replugging
											the transceiver to swapping the patch fibers and so far nothing has worked.
											OIT is doing some testing of their own, hopefully that will be more fruitful
										</li>
										<li>
											Despite having tried literally every tranciever in the lab, I apparently
											missed one which happened to be the one that we had to use
